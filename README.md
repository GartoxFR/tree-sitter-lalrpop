# tree-sitter-lalrpop

[LALRPOP](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop/) grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

The highlighting may not be the best right now, I still need to tweak it.

## Future plans

I want to add injections in order to handle the rusty-blocks, or even a totally new tree-sitter language, I don't quite know.
